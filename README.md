# Shairport Sync media player for Home Assistant

This custom [`media_player`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/)
for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) allows you to control and get
updates from a [Shairport Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/)
installation using [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/).

You need to compile Shairport Sync with at least the MQTT and metadata options,
for example:

```
 ./configure --with-mqtt-client --with-metadata
```

## Installation

### Manual

You need the Home Assistant
[MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) set up.

Copy the `shairport_sync` folder of this repo to
`<config_dir>/custom_components/shairport_sync/` of your Home Assistant
installation. Create the `custom_components` directory if it doesn't exist.

### HACS
Add the repository URL as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories).

## Configuration

### GUI
Click the `Add Integration` button and search for Shairport. Enter a friendly name, and the MQTT topic when prompted.

### YAML
Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`'s `media_player` section
replacing `your/mqtt/topic` with what's in your `shairport-sync.conf` and restart
Home Assistant:

```yaml
  - platform: shairport_sync
    name: Shairport Sync Player
    topic: your/mqtt/topic
```

### Shairport Sync
Some important settings required in your `shairport-sync.conf`:

```
mqtt =
{
    enabled = "yes";
    hostname = "<host_of_your_mqtt_broker>";
    port = 1883; // MQTT broker port; this is the default
    topic = "your/mqtt/topic";
    publish_parsed = "yes"; // For metadata
    publish_cover = "yes"; // Album art
    enable_remote = "yes"; // Remote control
}
```

## Compatibility

The current version of this integration has been tested against Shairport Sync 4.1 and Home Assistant Core 2023.1.7 & 2023.3.0.

Version 1.1.1 of this integration has been tested against Shairport Sync 3.3.7rc1 and Home Assistant Core
2021.12.5.

Version 1.0.3 of this integration was tested against Home Assistant 0.114.1 and supported up to version 2021.11.5.

Tested Shairport Sync details:
```
3.3.7rc1-alac-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-pipe-soxr-metadata-mqtt-sysconfdir:/etc.
```

## Troubleshooting

Enable logging and log an issue if necessary.

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.shairport_sync: debug
```

Shairport Sync's MQTT code is chatty so you will see duplicate log entries.

## Advanced Usage

If you have a device such as a Raspberry Pi that runs Shairport Sync which is connected to an
audio system that can be switched on and off with a smart plug and you would like to have a power
button on your media player card in Lovelace (Home Assistant) you can create a
[universal player](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/universal/). Here is an example
based on the example player config above.

```yaml
  - platform: universal
    name: Universal Shairport Sync Player
    children:
      - media_player.shairport_sync_player
    commands:
      turn_on:
        service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.your_smart_plug
      turn_off:
        service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.your_smart_plug
    attributes:
      state: switch.your_smart_plug
```

Here is one way to use this with the custom [Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) card.

```yaml
  - type: custom:mini-media-player
    name: Shairport Sync Player
    entity: media_player.universal_shairport_sync_player
    artwork: cover
    volume_stateless: true
    toggle_power: false  # make it use turn_on/turn_off instead of the toggle service
    hide:
      power: false
      power_state: false
      volume: false
      mute: true
    idle_view:
      when_idle: false
      when_paused: false
      when_standby: false
```

PS: Note the use of `toggle_power` above. Using the `toggle` service of the universal media player
won't work as expected in this case (it won't do anything). Tell MMP to use the explicit `turn_on` and `turn_off`
services instead. You can find more information [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-mini-media-player/68459/2242).
